[b][size=11]Known Problems:[/size][/b]
Some AnitVirus software makes trouble. 
Avast 2015 blocks sometimes the download of the setup files. If you switch off the web-scanner for that moment and check the files afterward it fine. I have not found what this problem cause.
Testes with Avira makes no problems till now.
